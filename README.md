# Project 3

Education project from edX HarvardX course: CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Pizza restaurant site

Requirements:


Adding Items: Using Django Admin, site administrators (restaurant owners) should be able to add, update, and remove items on the menu. Add all of the items from the Pinnochio’s menu into your database using either the Admin UI or by running Python commands in Django’s shell.

Registration, Login, Logout: Site users (customers) should be able to register for your web application with a username, password, first name, last name, and email address. Customers should then be able to log in and log out of your website.

Shopping Cart: Once logged in, users should see a representation of the restaurant’s menu, where they can add items (along with toppings or extras, if appropriate) to their virtual “shopping cart.” The contents of the shopping should be saved even if a user closes the window, or logs out and logs back in again.

Placing an Order: Once there is at least one item in a user’s shopping cart, they should be able to place an order, whereby the user is asked to confirm the items in the shopping cart, and the total (no need to worry about tax!) before placing an order.

Viewing Orders: Site administrators should have access to a page where they can view any orders that have already been placed.

Personal Touch: Allowing site administrators to mark orders as complete and allowing users to see the status of their pending or completed orders.
